# causal-effect-identification

## Experimental Design for Causal Effect Identification: objective of the project is to find a set of minimum cost to intervene upon to makes the causal query of interest identifiable, using an exact algorithm and a heuristic algorithm to reduce time complexity 
This project was done for the course titled "Causal Inference" and follows the paper: Sina Akbari, Jalal Etesami, and Negar Kiyavash Minimum cost intervention design for causal effect identification. In International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 258â€“289. PMLR, 2022.
